  "Middleware for expanding `METRIC` and `SEGMENT` 'macros' in *unexpanded* MBQL queries.

   Code in charge of expanding [\"METRIC\" ...] and [\"SEGMENT\" ...] forms in MBQL queries.
   (METRIC forms are expanded into aggregations and sometimes filter clauses, while SEGMENT forms
    are expanded into filter clauses.)

   TODO - this namespace is ancient and written with MBQL '95 in mind, e.g. it is case-sensitive.
   At some point this ought to be reworked to be case-insensitive and cleaned up."
